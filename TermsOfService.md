<h1>Vilicus' Terms of Service</h1>
The agreements for the users of Vilicus and the maintainers of the instance of Vilicus.

**Usage:**
By using Vilicus, users agree to have their information usable and manipulated for improving and general use of Vilicus. Any data collected will be collected anonymously and, in most cases, not stored.

There are two stages of data agreement in which users can interact with Vilicus. 

By inviting Vilicus into the guild, all users within the guild agree to the first stage. Data stored on this stage is limited to any guild-wide configurations, guild-wide features such prefix and any temporary cache of the user handled by the Discord.js library. Discord.js is a required package which allows Vilicus to communicate with Discord's API. Discord.js is open-sourced and anyone can see what this library does through their Github page linked here: https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js.

The second stage of data agreement is when a user uses Vilicus' save commands. These are used to ensure that the user agrees to such permissions and sets up the user profile within Vilicus' systems to contain data like: player in game profile tags (not verified to be belonging to them) for users ease of access,  etc... By using the save commands, the user is giving Vilicus explicit permission to store user data on the user outside of Discord. However, any data that is not from Discord such as usernames from other profiles, are all given through the use of other appropriate commands by the user. All user information is stored under their unique Discord ID.

All in game player tags, etc... that are used within Vilicus' commands are purely for Entertainement purposes.

<!-- Users are asked to make reports about any issues or feedback within Vilicus through its report command. This does not require any permission from the user as none of the report data is stored outside of Discord. -- Command is under construction -->

**Data Requests and Removal:**

Any users may contact the developer for their data on Vilicus at any time using the contact information defined in the contact section. The user's information will be sent to them after validation and in a way that is convenient for both parties. After the data has been received, the developer will make sure the sent file is deleted 48-72 hours laters. Any data received is up to the user's discretion and the developer is no longer responsible for said data after file deletion.

If a user requests for their user profile to be deleted, they may either use the revoke command within Vilicus or message the developer in the contact section below. The data will be deleted after validation with no questions asked. However, users should be warned that there is no recovery of deleted data and any user who deletes their profiles will be locked out of making a new profile for 24 hours. 

For self-hosted versions of Vilicus, users must send their requests to the person hosting the instance instead of the developer.

**Self-Hosting**

For any issues relating to a self-hosted instance of Vilicus, the user must send their requests to the person responsible for the self-hosting. The developer is not responsible for any misuse conducted by the self-hosted instances of the program. However, if general questions about Vilicus do arise, please see the Contact section of the terms for information on how to get in touch.

**Disclaimer:**

If for any reason Vilicus needs to store more data, these terms may change with notice to reflect the state of the project. These changes may not be brought to user's notice and it is up to the user to see for themselves what has changed between releases. If there are any questions about recent changes, the user may contact the developer through the information in the contact section.

The developer of Vilicus does not knowingly know of any stored data of users under the age of 13. If a user under the age of 13 is found with data on Vilicus, the data will be deleted and the user will be reported to Discord.

The developer of Vilicus does not knowingly store any data of users under the age of 13 nor of any user who's account has been deleted. If data on a user with either of the items mentioned exist within Vilicus, the data will be deleted.

**Agreement:**

Users are aware and agree to the following terms defined above. They are also aware that changes in the Terms of Service may be made any time without any prior notification to the user. 

**Contact:**

For any questions, complaints, etc... either contact me via my Discord server (https://discord.gg/invite-needs-to-be-made) or dm me on discord.
